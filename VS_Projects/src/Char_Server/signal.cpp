 * NOTE: SIGINT is produced when the user presses Ctrl-C.
 *       SIGILL has not been tested.
 *       SIGFPE doesn't seem to work?
 *       SIGSEGV does not catch writing to a NULL pointer (that shuts down
 *               your app; can you say "segmentation violation core dump"?).
 *       SIGTERM comes from what kind of termination request exactly?
 *       SIGBREAK is indeed produced by pressing Ctrl-Break.
 *       SIGABRT is produced by calling abort.
